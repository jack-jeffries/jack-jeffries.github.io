<h3>Textbook:</h3> Understanding Real Analysis, by Paul Zorn. Any edition is fine. This book is optional. The role of the book is as an independent resource for you. I will also post lecture notes online once the semester starts.

<h3>Course content:</h3> In this class, we will explore the real numbers, 
and understand precisely what makes calculus work. In this pursuit, we will develop our proof-writing techniques
and our ability to state and work with definitions. The course material breaks into four main topics:
<ul>
<li> Sets, proofs, and the real numbers</li>
<li> Sequences and series</li>
<li> Limits and continuity</li>
<li> Derivatives</li>
</ul>
Class time will involve a combination of lecture and groupwork. You will be expected to prepare for class by reading in advance. This class will build on the proof skills developed in Math 309 and Math 310. If you want to prepare for this class in the week before school, read sections 1.2 and 1.4 of the textbook.

<h3>Office hours</h3>
<ul>
<li>Monday 9:30am&ndash;11am in Avery 325 (Jack)</li>
<li>Wednesday 1:30&ndash;3pm in Avery 325 (Jack)</li>
<li>or by appointment (Jack)</li>
<li>Tuesday 7pm&ndash;8pm in Avery 13 (David)</li>
<li>Thursday 7pm&ndash;8pm in Avery 13 (David)</li>
<li>zoom OH for David at times above by request</li>
</ul> 



<h3>Problem Sets</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://jack-jeffries.github.io/F24/325/HW1.pdf">Problem Set #1</a> due Thursday, Sept 5</li>
<li><a href="https://jack-jeffries.github.io/F24/325/HW2.pdf">Problem Set #2</a> due Tuesday, Sept 17</li>
</ul>

 The <i>complete</i> list of <i>acceptable</i> resources for you to use when working on problem sets is
<ul>
<li>your instructor, in office hours</li>
<li>your peers; but you must write your solutions on your own</li>
<li>the course materials on this website</li>
<li>any notes you have taken in class, while studying for this class, or any other class</li>
<li>the recommended texts listed above, though if any exercise is solved in the other texts, you should not consult the solution there</li>
<li>the textbook for 817&nbsp;818 material <i>Abstract Algebra</i> by Dummit and Foote.
<li>the computer algebra program Macaulay2</li>
<li>other basic computational software, like the standard calculator app on your cell phone, Desmos, or Geogebra</li>
<li>typesetting software like LaTeX</li>
<li>your course assistant, if we end up getting one</li></ul>
If there is any resource that you think should be on this list, or has unclear membership status to this list, please consult me. <!--An <i>incomplete</i> list of <i>unacceptable</i> resources worthy of mention are: googling a problem, proof wikis, pdfs of solutions to a textbook, Math Stack Exchange, Chegg, and ChatGPT.-->









<h3>How to succeed in this class:</h3>
Math 325 is one of the most challenging undergraduate math classes we offer, since it is based on developing a skill set that is very different from our 100 and 200-level courses. You should be prepared to invest a large amount of time outside of class. Here are a few specific keys to success:
<ul>
<li><i>Start working on homework sets early.</i> It takes a lot of time to figure out and properly write a proof.</li>
<li><i>Read the textbook before class and review the lecture notes after class.</i> We will devote a large portion of class to groupwork, so lecture will be fast, and some parts of the material will be relegated to your reading outside of class.</li>
<li><i>Carefully commit the definitions and important theorems to memory.</i> Definition and theorem statements will be on the quizzes and exams, and we will need to know our definitions precisely in order to do anything at all in this class. In my experience, scores on definition portions of the exams correlate very highly with overall grades in the course.</li>
<li><i>Don't let early material slip by unperfected.</i> If you don't understand something early in the class or haven't perfected a skill, do not ignore it and hope that it goes away. We will build off of these skills throughout the rest of the course.</li>
<li><i>Utilize office hours, and not just for homework problems.</i> My office hours are time set aside specifically for you to talk to me about the course material. You can stop by during any office hour without an appointment or any heads-up. You can also write to ask about meeting me at a different time if you cannot meet me during the regularly scheduled office hours.</li>
</ul>
I am confident that you (yes, you!) can succeed in this class if you are willing to work hard in and outside of class and you follow the tips above.
