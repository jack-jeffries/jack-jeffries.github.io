<h4>What is Commutative Algebra?</h4>

In short, Commutative Algebra is the study of commutative rings. Wherever there are numbers or functions, rings are generally lurking in the background. Commutative Algebra largely developed to explain the strange similarities between integers and polynomials, and has deep connections to Algebraic Geometry, Number Theory, Complex Analysis, and Representation Theory.
	
	Three major themes in this course will be:
<ul><li> Every ring is a geometric object! We will come to think of rings in this way, in addition to their more obvious nature as bags of knickknacks that can be added, subtracted, and multiplied.</li>
<li> The hypothesis studied by and named in honor of Emmy Noether has incredible finiteness properties. Investigating these will be a recurring feature.</li>
<li> While there will be many definitions and theorems, we will stay grounded and become quite familiar with many actual rings.</li></ul>

<h4>Prerequisites</h4>We will lean upon some basics of rings, ideals, and modules, as covered in the Math 817&ndash;818 sequence. In particular, you should be familiar with the definitions of ring, ideal, and module; quotient rings and quotient modules; the First, Second, and Third Isomorphism Theorems for rings and modules; polynomial rings; PIDs and UFDs; free modules; the structure theory of finitely generated modules over PIDs; and Gauss' and Eisenstein's criteria. If you are unfamiliar with these things, I recommend reaching out to me to discuss.
	
	We will also use some of the basic notions from point set topology (abstract topological space, continuous function, and connectedness) and elementary real analysis (epsilon-delta definition of continuity). If you are unfamiliar with any of these things, I recommend meeting me so I can point you to some background reading before the course.

<h4>Relationship to other courses</h4> This course is a prerequisite for Math 953: Algebraic Geometry, which will be offered in Spring 2025, Math 918: Topics in Commutative Algebra, offered Spring 2025 &amp; 2026, and Math 906: Commutative Algebra II, offered in Spring 2026. Math 905 runs on a two-year cycle, and will not run again until Fall 2026.

<h4>Style of class</h4><b>This will be an active learning course.</b> Class time will be dedicated to working in groups instead of lecture. Each class day, we will have a worksheet exploring new definitions, examples, and theorems. Math is learned by working through proofs and examples. I could tell you about all of the interesting commutative algebra I know, and I could mix it in with funny anecdotes and obscure puns, but my algebra will never be your own until you do it. This style of class may stretch our comfort zone more than a conventional lecture, but it is a better approximation of doing research and writing a thesis than the latter.
 
<h4>Requirements</h4> Attendance is required.
	We will cover a lot of material in this course. To facilitate effective group work, you will be expected to read a 1&ndash;2 page summary of the day's new definitions and theorems before class, and to review the new material after class. We will also have fortnightly homework assignments, which may include some problems from the worksheets, and will involve some basic computations with the computer algebra system Macaulay2.

 <h4>Textbooks and other resources</h4> There is no required text for the course. The worksheets we go through will be largely self-contained, but the worksheet previews will give pointers to related sections of <a href="https://eloisagrifo.github.io/Teaching/ca1/CA1notes.pdf">Elo&iacute;sa Grifo's Math 905 lecture notes from Fall 2022</a>  and the seminal <i>Introduction to commutative algebra</i> by Atiyah and MacDonald. Other sources that cover similar material include <i>A term of commutative algebra</i> by Altman and Kleiman,  <a href="https://dept.math.lsa.umich.edu/~hochster/614F20/614Lx.pdf">Mel Hochster's Math 614 Lecture notes</a>, and <i>Commutative Algebra with a view towards Algebraic Geometry</i> by Eisenbud. 

<h3>Problem sets</h3>
Links to the problem sets appear below.

<ul><li><a href="https://jack-jeffries.github.io/F24/905/HW/HW1.pdf">Problem Set #1</a> <a href="https://jack-jeffries.github.io/F24/905/HW/HW1.tex">tex</a>, due Friday, September 6</li>
</ul>


 The <i>complete</i> list of <i>acceptable</i> resources for you to use when working on problem sets is
<ul>
<li>your instructor, in office hours</li>
<li>your peers; but you must write your solutions on your own</li>
<li>the course materials on this website</li>
<li>any notes you have taken in class, while studying for this class, or any other class</li>
<li>the recommended texts listed above, though if any exercise is solved in the other texts, you should not consult the solution there</li>
<li>the textbook for 817&ndash;818 material <i>Abstract Algebra</i> by Dummit and Foote.
<li>the computer algebra program Macaulay2</li>
<li>other basic computational software, like the standard calculator app on your cell phone, Desmos, or Geogebra</li>
<li>typesetting software like LaTeX</li>
<li>your course assistant, if we end up getting one</li></ul>
If there is any resource that you think should be on this list, or has unclear membership status to this list, please consult me. An <i>incomplete</i> list of <i>unacceptable</i> resources worthy of mention are: googling a problem, proof wikis, pdfs of solutions to a textbook, Math Stack Exchange, Chegg, and ChatGPT.
