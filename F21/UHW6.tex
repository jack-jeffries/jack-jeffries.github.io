{\bf Instructions:} You are encouraged to work together on these
problems, but each student should hand in their own final draft,
written in a way that indicates their individual understanding of
the solutions. Never submit something for grading
that you do not completely understand. 

If you do work with others, I ask that you write something along the
top like ``I collaborated with Steven Smale on problems 1 and 3''.
If you use a reference, indicate so clearly in your solutions. 
In short, be intellectually
honest at all times.

Please write neatly, using complete sentences and correct
punctuation. Label the problems clearly. 






\begin{enumerate}
	
	\item Prove by induction on $n$ that 
	\[ 1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + \cdots + n^3 = \Big(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\Big)^2 \]
	for all $n \in \mathbb N$. 
	
	\ 
	
	\item Let $\{a_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$ be a sequence and let $L$ be a real number.  Show that $\{a_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$ converges to $L$ if and only if the subsequences $\{a_{2k}\}_{k=1}^\infty$ and $\{a_{2k-1}\}_{k=1}^\infty$ both converge to $L$.
