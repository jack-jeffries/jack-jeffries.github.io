<p>
          These are the lecture notes and class materials for Math 817 Introduction to Modern Algebra I
          in Fall 2025. This is the first of a two-part course on groups, rings, modules, and fields.
          In this first half, we will discuss group theory, including group actions, and introduce rings.
          A major goal of this course is to prepare graduate students for the PhD qualifying exam in algebra.
        </p>
<p>
          The lecture notes draw heavily on
          <a aria-label="Eloísa Grifo’s Algebra Notes, PDF in a new tab" href="https://eloisagrifo.github.io/Teaching/algebra.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
            Eloísa Grifo’s Algebra Notes (PDF, opens in new tab)
          </a>,
          which in turn draw from earlier lecture notes of Mark Walker and Alexandra Seceleanu.
          The textbook <em>Abstract Algebra</em> by Dummit and Foote is a good resource covering similar material.

<section aria-labelledby="lecture-heading" id="an introduction to groups">
<h1 id="lecture-heading">1. An Introduction to Groups</h1>
<p>This class has four major topics: Groups, Rings, Modules, and Fields. Let us begin with group theory.</p>
<p>
          A group is a basic algebraic structure that is found in many objects we might otherwise care about,
          but has enough structure that we can deduce general statements and theorems.
        </p>
<section aria-labelledby="defs-heading" id="definitions-first-examples">
<h2 id="defs-heading">1.1 Definitions and first examples</h2>
<section aria-labelledby="def-binary-op" class="callout definition" role="region">
<h3 id="def-binary-op">Definition 1.1.1 (Binary operation)</h3>
<p>
              A <dfn>binary operation</dfn> on a set \(S\) is a function \(S \times S \to S\).
              If the binary operation is denoted by \(\cdot\), we write \(x \cdot y\) for the image of \((x,y)\).
            </p>
</section>
<section aria-labelledby="rmk-xy" class="callout remark" role="region">
<h3 id="rmk-xy">Remark 1.1.2</h3>
<p>We often write \(xy\) instead of \(x \cdot y\) if the operation is clear from context.</p>
</section>
<section aria-labelledby="rmk-closure" class="callout remark" role="region">
<h3 id="rmk-closure">Remark 1.1.3 ("Closed under \(\cdot\)")</h3>
<p>
              We say that a set \(S\) is closed under the operation \(\cdot\) when we want to emphasize
              that for any \(x,y\in S\) the result \(xy\) belongs to \(S\). Closure is part of the definition
              of a binary operation and is implicitly assumed.
            </p>
</section>
<section aria-labelledby="def-group" class="callout definition" role="region">
<h3 id="def-group">Definition 1.1.4 (Group)</h3>
<p>
              A <dfn>group</dfn> is a set \(G\) with a binary operation \(\cdot\) (group multiplication) such that:
            </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Associativity:</strong> For all \(x,y,z \in G\), \((x\cdot y)\cdot z = x\cdot(y\cdot z)\).</li>
<li><strong>Identity element:</strong> There exists \(e\in G\) with \(e\cdot x = x = x\cdot e\) for all \(x\in G\).</li>
<li><strong>Inverses:</strong> For each \(x\in G\) there is \(y\in G\) with \(xy=e=yx\).</li>
</ul>
<p>
              The element \(e\) is the <strong>identity</strong>. For each \(x\in G\), an element \(y\) with \(xy=e=yx\)
              is an <strong>inverse</strong> of \(x\). The <strong>order</strong> of \(G\) is the number of elements in \(G\).
            </p>
</section>
<section aria-labelledby="ex-glnr" class="callout example" role="region">
<h3 id="ex-glnr">Example 1.1.5 (General linear group)</h3>
<div aria-label="Definition of GL sub n over R" class="math-display" role="math">
              \[
                GL_n(\mathbb{R}) := \{\, \text{invertible } n\times n \text{ matrices with entries in } \mathbb{R}\,\}.
              \]
            </div>
<p>
              This is a group under matrix multiplication: associativity holds, the identity matrix is the identity,
              and every element has an inverse by definition.
            </p>
</section>

Vaguely, the definition of group is motivated by the idea that a collection of functions from set to itself that preserves some extra structure naturally satisfies the three axioms: for example, the general linear group consists of functions from the vector space \(\mathbb{R}^n\) to itself that preserve the linearity structure.


          <section aria-labelledby="rmk-underlying-set" class="callout remark" role="region">
<h3 id="rmk-underlying-set">Remark 1.1.6 (Naming groups)</h3>
<p>Although a group is the set <em>and</em> the operation, we often refer to it by the underlying set \(G\).</p>
</section>
<section aria-labelledby="rmk-monoid" class="callout remark" role="region">
<h3 id="rmk-monoid">Remark 1.1.7 (Semigroups and monoids)</h3>
<p>
              A set with an associative binary operation is a <strong>semigroup</strong>; if it has an identity, it is a
              <strong>monoid</strong>. While we will not study non-group monoids in this course, they’re useful objects.

<h3 id="proof-unique">Proof of Lemma 1.1.8</h3>
<p>
              If \(e\) and \(e'\) are both identities, then \(e = ee' = e'\).
              If \(y\) and \(z\) are both inverses of \(x\), then
              \(z = (yx)z = y(xz) = ye = y\).

            There is no algorithm that, given any group presentation as an input, can decide whether the group is actually the trivial group with just one element.
        
            There exist a presentation with finitely many generators and finitely many relations such that whether or not the group is actually the trivial group with just one element is <em>independent of the standard axioms of mathematics</em>!
          
Nonetheless, finding and working with presentations of groups is a crucial technique in group theory.

  We need to show \(\sigma_1(\sigma_2(l)) = \sigma_2(\sigma_1(l))\) for all \(l \in [n]\). If \(l \notin \{i_1, \ldots, i_m, j_1, \dots, j_k\}\), Then \(\sigma_1(l) = l = \sigma_2(l)\), so

<p>
  If \(l \in \{j_1, \dots, j_k\}\), then \(\sigma_2(l) \in \{j_1, \dots, j_k\}\) and hence, since the subsets are disjoint, \(l\) and \(\sigma_2(l)\) are not in the set \(\{i_1 , i_2 , \dots i_m\}\). It follows that \(\sigma_1\) preserves \(l\) and \(\sigma_2(l)\), and thus

    For the uniqueness part of the Theorem, one needs to establish a convention regarding 1-cycles: we need to decide whether the 1-cycles will be recorded. If we decide not to record \(1\)-cycles, this gives the shorter version of our factorization into cycles. If all the 1-cycles are recorded, this gives a longer version of our factorization, but this option has the advantage that it makes it clear what the size \(n\) of our group \(S_n\) is. 
  </p>
<p>
    We will follow the first convention: we will write only \(m\)-cycles with \(m \geqslant 2\). Under this convention, the identity element of \(S_n\) is the empty product of disjoint cycles. We will, however, sometimes denote the identity by \((1)\) for convenience.
  </p>
</section>
<section aria-labelledby="proof-disjoint-decomp" class="callout proof" role="region">
<h3 id="proof-disjoint-decomp">Proof of Theorem 1.2.12</h3>
<p>
  Fix a permutation \(\sigma\).
  The key idea is to look at the <dfn>orbits</dfn> of \(\sigma\): for each \(x \in [n]\), its orbit by \(\sigma\) is the subset of \([n]\) of the form
</p>
<div class="math-display">
\[
O_x=\{ \sigma(x), \sigma^2(x), \sigma^3(x), \ldots \} = \{\sigma^i(x) \mid i \geqslant 1 \}.
\]
</div>
<p>
  Notice that the orbits of two elements \(x\) and \(y\) are either the same orbit, which happens precisely when \(y \in O_x\), or disjoint.
  Since \([n]\) is a finite set, and \(\sigma\) is a bijection of \(\sigma\), we will eventually have \(\sigma^i(x) = \sigma^j(x)\) for some \(j &gt; i\), but then
</p>
<div class="math-display">
\[
\sigma^{j-i}(x) = \sigma^{i-i}(x) = \sigma^0(x) = x.
\]
</div>
<p>
  Thus we can find the smallest positive integer \(n_x\) such that \(\sigma^{n_x}(x)=x\). Now for each \(x \in [n]\), we consider the cycle
</p>
<div class="math-display">
\[
\tau_x = (\sigma(x) \,\, \sigma^2(x) \,\, \sigma^3(x) \, \cdots \, \sigma^{n_x}(x)).
\]
</div>
<p>
  Now let \(S\) be a set of indices for the distinct \(\tau_x\), where note that we are not including the \(\tau_x\) that are \(1\)-cycles. We claim that we can factor \(\sigma\) as
</p>
<div class="math-display">
\[
\sigma=\prod_{i\in S}\tau_i.
\]
</div>
<p>
  To show this, consider any \(x \in [n]\). It must be of the form \(\sigma^j(i)\) for some \(i \in S\), given that our choice of \(S\) was exhaustive. On the right hand side, only \(\tau_i\) moves \(x\), and indeed by definition of \(\tau_i\) we have
</p>
<div class="math-display">
\[
\tau_i(x) = \sigma^{j+1}(i) = \sigma(\sigma^j(i)) = \sigma(x).
\]
</div>
<p>
  This proves that
</p>
<div class="math-display">
\[
\sigma=\prod_{i\in S}\tau_i.
\]
</div>
<p>
  As for uniqueness, note that if \(\sigma = \tau_1 \cdots \tau_s\) is a product of disjoint cycles, then each \(x \in [n]\) is moved by at most one of the cycles \(\tau_i\), since the cycles are all disjoint. Fix \(i\) such that \(\tau_i\) moves \(x\). We claim that
</p>
<div class="math-display">
\[
\tau_x = (\sigma(x) \,\, \sigma^2(x) \,\,\sigma^3(x) \, \cdots \, \sigma^{n_x}(x)).
\]
</div>
<p>
  This will show that our product of disjoint cycles giving \(\sigma\) is the same (unique) product we constructed above. To do this, note that we do know that there is some integer \(s\) such that \(\tau_x^s(x) = e\), and
</p>
<div class="math-display">
\[
\tau_x = (\tau_x(x) \,\, \tau_x^2(x) \,\, \tau_x^3(x) \, \cdots \, \tau_x^{s}(x)).
\]
</div>
<p>
  Thus we need only to prove that
</p>
<div class="math-display">
\[
\tau_x^k(x) = \sigma^k(x)
\]
</div>
<p>
  for all integers \(k \geqslant 1\). Now by the Theorem, disjoint cycles commute, and thus for each integer \(k \geqslant 1\) we have
</p>
<div class="math-display">
\[
\sigma^k = \tau_1^k \cdots \tau_s^k.
\]
</div>
<p>
  But \(\tau_j\) fixes \(x\) whenever \(j \neq i\), so
</p>
<div class="math-display">
\[
\sigma^k = \tau_i^k (x).
\]
</div>
<p>
  We conclude that the integer \(n_x\) we defined before is the length of the cycle \(\tau_i\), and that
</p>
<div class="math-display">
\[
\tau_i = (x \, \tau_i(x) \, \tau_i^2(x) \cdots \tau_i^{n_x-1}(x)) = (x \, \sigma(x) \, \sigma^2(x) \cdots \sigma^{n_x-1}(x)).
\]
</div>
<p>
  Thus this decomposition of \(\sigma\) as a product of disjoint cycles is the same decomposition we described above.

This is an odd number, so it suffices to show that it is not possible to write the identity as a product of an odd number of transpositions. </p> <p> Suppose the identity can be written as the product \((a_1 b_1) \cdots (a_k b_k)\), where each \(a_i \neq b_i\). A single transposition \emph{cannot} be the identity, and thus \(k \neq 1\). So assume, for the sake of an argument by induction, that for a fixed \(k\), we know that every product of fewer than \(k\) transpositions that equals the identity must use an even number of transpositions. Since \(2\) is even, we might as well assume \(k \geqslant 3\). Now note that since \(k > 1\), and our product is the identity, then some transposition \((a_i b_i)\) with \(i > 1\) must move \(a_1\); otherwise, \(b_1\) would be sent to \(a_1\), and our product would not be the identity. </p> <p> Of all the possible ways we can write the identity as a product of \(k\) many transpositions \((a_1 b_1) \cdots (a_k b_k)\) with \(a_1 = a\) and \(b_1 = b\) fixed, choose one where the number \(N\) of times that \(a_1\) appears in one of the transpositions is smallest. The two rules in Exercise 1.2.21 allow us to rewrite the overall product without changing the number of transpositions in such a way that the transposition \((a_2 b_2)\) moves \(a_1\), meaning \(a_2 = a_1\) or \(b_2=a_1\). So let us assume that our product of transpositions has already been put in this form. Note also that \((a_i b_i) = (b_i a_i)\), so we might as well assume without loss of generality that \(a_2 = a_1\). </p> <p> <u>Case 1</u>: When \(b_1 = b_2\), our product is </p> <div class="math-display"> \[ (a_1 b_1) (a_1 b_1) (a_3 b_3) \cdots (a_k b_k), \] </div> <p> but \((a_1 b_1) (a_1 b_1)\) is the identity, so we can rewrite our product using only \(k-2\) transpositions. By induction hypothesis, \(k-2\) is even, and thus \(k\) is even. </p> <p> <u>Case 2</u>: When \(b_1 \neq b_2\), we can use Exercise 1.2.21 to write </p> <div class="math-display"> \[ (a_1 b_1) (a_1 b_2) = (a_1 b_1) (b_2 a_1) = (a_1b_2)(b_1b_2). \] </div> <p> Notice here that it matters that \(a_1\), \(b_1\), and \(b_2\) are all distinct, so that we can apply Exercise 1.2.21. So our product, which equals the identity, is </p> <div class="math-display"> \[ (a_1 b_2)(b_1 b_2)(a_3 b_3) \cdots (a_k b_k). \] </div> <p> The advantage of this shuffling is that while we have only changed the first two transpositions, we have decreased the number \(N\) of transpositions that move \(a_1\).

<p>
      There are competing notations for the group of symmetries of the \(n\)-gon. Some authors prefer to write it as \(D_{2n}\), since, as we will show, that is the order of the group. Democracy has dictated that we will be denoting it by \(D_n\), which indicates that we are talking about the symmetries of the \(n\)-gon. Some authors like to write \(D_{2 \times n}\), always keeping the \(2\), for example with \(D_{2 \times 3}\), to satisfy both camps.
    </p>

<p>
    Let \(d(-,-)\) denote the usual Euclidean distance between two points on the plane \(\mathbb{R}^2\). An <dfn>isometry</dfn> of the plane is a function \(f\!: \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^2\) that is bijective and preserves the Euclidean distance, meaning that
  </p>
<div class="math-display">
    \[
      d(f(A),f(B))=d(A,B) \quad \textrm{ for all } A,B \in \mathbb{R}^2.
    \]
  </div>
<p>
    Though not obvious, it is a fact that if \(f\) preserves the distance between every pair of points in the plane, then it must be a bijection.
  </p>
<p>
    A <dfn>symmetry</dfn> of \(P_n\) is an isometry of the plane that maps \(P_n\) to itself. By this I do not mean that \(f\) fixes each point of \(P_n\), but rather that we have an equality of sets \(f(P_n) = P_n\), meaning every point of \(P_n\) is mapped to a (possibly different) point of \(P_n\) and every point of \(P_n\) is the image of some point in \(P_n\) via \(f\).
  </p>
<p>We are now ready to give the formal definition of the dihedral groups:</p>
<section aria-labelledby="rmk-1-3-groupcheck" class="callout remark" role="region">
<h3 id="rmk-1-3-groupcheck">Remark 1.3.4</h3>
<p>
      Let us informally verify that this really is a group.
      If \(f\) and \(g\) are in \(D_n\), then \(f \circ g\) is an isometry (since the composition of any two isometries is again an isometry) and
    </p>
<div class="math-display">
      \[
        (f \circ g)(P_n) = f(g(P_n)) = f(P_n) = P_n,
      \]
    </div>
<p>
      so that \(f \circ g \in D_n\). This proves composition is a binary operation on \(D_n\).
      Now note that associativity of composition is a general property of functions.
      The identity function on \(\mathbb{R}^2\), denoted \(\mathrm{id}_{\mathbb{R}^2}\), belongs to \(D_n\) and it is the identity element of \(D_n\).
      Finally, the inverse function of an isometry is also an isometry. Using this, we see that every element of \(D_n\) has an inverse.

Let \(r\) denote the rotation about the origin by \(\frac{2\pi}{n}\) radians counterclockwise; this is an element of \(D_n\). Its inverse is the clockwise rotation by \(\frac{2 \pi}{n}\).

<p>
Fix \(n \geqslant 3\). We will consider two special elements of \(D_n\):
    </p>
<ul>
<li>Let \(r\) denote the symmetry of \(P_n\) given by counterclockwise rotation by \(\frac{2 \pi}{n}\).</li>
<li>
        Let \(s\) denote a reflection symmetry of \(P_n\) that fixes at least one of the vertices of \(P_n\), as described in Definition 1.3.9.
        Let \(V_1\) be a vertex of \(P_n\) that is fixed by \(s\), and label the remaining vertices of \(P_n\) with \(V_2, \ldots, V_{n}\) by going counterclockwise from \(V_1\).
      </li>
</ul>
<p>
      From now on, whenever we are talking about \(D_n\), the letters \(r\) and \(s\) will refer only to these specific elements. Finally, we will sometimes denote the identity element of \(D_n\) by \(\mathrm{id}\), since it is the identity map.

<h3 id="prf-1-3-2n">Proof of Theorem 1.3.12</h3>
<p>
      First, we show that \(D_n\) has order at most \(2n\). Any element \(\sigma \in D_n\) takes the polygon \(P_n\) to itself, and must in particular send vertices to vertices and preserve adjacencies, meaning that any two adjacent vertices remain adjacent after applying \(\sigma\). Fix two adjacent vertices \(A\) and \(B\). By Lemma 1.3.5, the location of every other point \(P\) on the polygon after applying \(\sigma\) is completely determined by the locations of \(\sigma(A)\) and \(\sigma(B)\). There are \(n\) distinct possibilities for \(\sigma(A)\), since it must be one of the \(n\) vertices of the polygon. But once \(\sigma(A)\) is fixed, \(\sigma(B)\) must be a vertex adjacent to \(\sigma(B)\), so there are at most \(2\) possibilities for \(\sigma(B)\). This gives us at most \(2n\) elements in \(D_n\).
    </p>
<p>
      Now we need only to present \(2n\) distinct elements in \(D_n\). We have described \(n\) reflections and \(n\) rotations for \(D_n\); we need only to see that they are all distinct. First, note that the only rotation that fixes any vertices of \(P_n\) is the identity. Moreover, if we label the vertices of \(P_n\) in order with \(1, 2, \ldots, n\), say by starting in a fixed vertex and going counterclockwise through each adjacent vertex, then the rotation by an angle of \(\frac{2 \pi i}{n}\) sends \(V_{1}\) to \(V_{i+1}\) for each \(i \lt n \), 
showing these \(n\) rotations are distinct. Now when \(n\) is odd, each of the \(n\) reflections fixes exactly one vertex, and so they are all distinct and disjoint from the rotations. Finally, when \(n\) is even, we have two kinds of reflections to consider. The reflections through a line connecting opposite vertices have exactly two fixed vertices, and are completely determined by which two vertices are fixed; since rotations have no fixed points, none of these matches any of the rotations we have already considered. The other reflections, the ones through the midpoint of two opposite sides, are completely determined by (one of) the two pairs of adjacent vertices that they switch. No rotation switches two adjacent vertices, and thus these give us brand new elements of \(D_n\). 

<p>
      In both cases, we have a total of \(2n\) distinct elements of \(D_n\) given by the \(n\) rotations and the \(n\) reflections.

      Thus \(\alpha(V_1) = V_ j\) for some \(1 \leqslant j \leqslant n\) and therefore the element \(r^{-j}\alpha\) fixes \(V_1\) and the origin. The only elements that fix \(V_1\) are the identity and \(s\). Hence either \(r^{-j}\alpha = \mathrm{id}\) or \(r^{-j}\alpha = s\). We conclude that \(\alpha = r^j\) or \(\alpha = r^js\).

      Theorem 1.3.19 shows that \(\{r,s\}\) is a set of generators for \(D_n\). Moreover, we also know that the relations listed above \(r^n = 1, s^2 = 1, srs^{-1} = r^{-1}\) hold; the first two are easy to check, and the last one is Lemma 1.3.16. The only concern we need to deal with is that we may not have discovered all the relations of \(D_n\); or rather, we need to check that we have found enough relations so that any other valid relation follows as a consequence of the ones listed.

      Assume that \(D_n\) has more relations than \(X_{2n}\) does. Then \(D_n\) would be a group of cardinality strictly smaller than \(X_{2n}\), meaning that \(|D_n|&lt;|X_{2n}|\). This will become more clear once we properly define presentations.

      Now we show that \(X_{2n}\) has at most \(2n\) elements using just the information contained in the presentation. By definition, since \(r\) and \(s\) generated \(X_{2n}\) then every element \(x\in X_{2n}\) can be written as
    </p>
<div class="math-display">
      \[
        x = r^{m_1} s^{n_1} r^{m_2} s^{n_2} \cdots r^{m_j} s^{n_j}
      \]
    </div>
<p>
      for some \(j\) and (possibly negative) integers \(m_1, \dots, m_j, n_1, \dots, m_j\).Note that, \(m_1\) could be \(0\), so that expressions beginning with a power of \(s\) are included in this list.
      As a consequence of the last relation, we have
    </p>
<div class="math-display">
      \[
        sr = r^{-1}s,
      \]
    </div>
<p>and its not hard to see that this implies</p>
<div class="math-display">
      \[
        sr^m = r^{-m} s
      \]
    </div>
<p>for all \(m\).
      Thus, we can slide an \(s\) past a power of \(r\), at the cost of changing the sign of the power. Doing this repeatedly gives that we can rewrite \(x\) as
    </p>
<div class="math-display">
      \[
        x = r^M s^N.
      \]
    </div>
<p>
      By the first relation, \(r^n = 1\), from which it follows that \(r^a = r^b\) if \(a\) and \(b\) are congruent modulo \(n\). Thus we may assume \(0 \leqslant M \leqslant n-1.\) Likewise, we may assume \(0 \leqslant N \leqslant 1\). This gives a total of at most \(2n\) elements, and we conclude that \(X_{2n}\) must in fact be \(D_n.\)
    </p>
</section>

    Note that we have <em>not</em> shown that

<p>
    has at least \(2n\) elements using just the presentation. But for this particular example, since we know the group presented is the same as \(D_n\), we know from Theorem 1.3.19 that it has exactly \(2n\) elements.

      Let \((G, \cdot_G)\) and \((H, \cdot_H)\) be groups.

    <h3>Definition 1.5.2</h3>

      If \(f:G\to H\) is an isomorphism, \(G\) and \(H\) are called <strong>isomorphic</strong>, and we denote this by writing \(G\cong H\).
      An isomorphism \(G \longrightarrow G\) is called an <dfn>automorphism</dfn> of \(G\). We denote the set of all automorphisms of \(G\) by \(\mathrm{Aut}(G)\).

  </section>

  <section class="callout remark" role="region">
    <h3>Remark 1.5.3</h3>
    <p>
      Two groups \(G\) and \(H\) are isomorphic if we can obtain \(H\) from \(G\) by renaming all the elements, without changing the group structure.
      One should think of an isomorphism \(f\!: G \longrightarrow{\cong} H\) of groups as saying that the multiplication tables of \(G\) and \(H\) are the same up to renaming the elements.
    </p>
    <p>
      The multiplication rule \(\cdot_G\) for \(G\) can be visualized as a table with both rows and columns labeled by elements of \(G\), and with \(x \cdot_G y\) placed in row \(x\) and column \(y\).
      The isomorphism \(f\) sends \(x\) to \(f(x)\), \(y\) to \(f(y)\), and the table entry \(x \cdot_G y\) to the table entry \(f(x) \cdot_H f(y)\). The inverse map \(f^{-1}\) does the opposite.

  </section>

  <section class="callout remark" role="region">
    <h3>Remark 1.5.4</h3>
    <p>
      Suppose that \(f\!: G \to H\) is an isomorphism. As a function, \(f\) has an inverse, and thus it must necessarily be a bijective function.
      Our definition, however, requires more: the inverse must in fact also be a group homomorphism.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that many books define group isomorphism by simply requiring it to be a homomorphism that is bijective: and we will soon show that this is in fact equivalent to the definition we gave.
      There are however good reasons to define it as we did: in many contexts, such as sets, groups, rings, fields, or topological spaces, the correct meaning of the word “isomorphism” in “a morphism that has a two-sided inverse”.
      This explains our choice of definition.

    <h3>Proof of Lemma 1.5.12</h3>
    <p>
      First, note that \(e_G \in \ker f\) by Lemma 1.5.7. If \(f\) is injective, then \(e_G\) must be the only element that \(f\) sends to \(e_H\), and thus \(\ker(f) = \{ e_G \}\).

      f(h^{-1}g) = f(h^{-1})f(g) = f(h)^{-1}f(g) = e_H.

    </p>
    <p>
      So \(f(\alpha) = \sigma\) where \(\sigma\) is the permutation that for all \(1 \leqslant i \leqslant n\), if \(\alpha\) sends the \(i\)th vertex to the \(j\)th one in the list, then \(\sigma(i) = j\).
      This map \(f\) is a group homomorphism.

      Now suppose \(f(\alpha) = \mathrm{id}_{S_n}\). Then \(\alpha\) must fix all the vertices of \(P_n\), and thus \(\alpha\) must be the identity element of \(D_n\).

Some would say this is the main reason one would study groups, so we want to introduce it early both as motivation for studying group theory but also because the language of group actions will be very helpful to us.

        \(\mu_g\!:S\longrightarrow S\) denote the function given by \(\mu_g(s)=g \cdot s\).
        Then the function
        <div class="math-display">
          \[
          \rho\!: G \to \mathrm{Perm}(S), \quad g \mapsto \mu_g

        is a well-defined homomorphism of groups.
      </li>
      <li>
        Conversely, if \(\rho: G \to \mathrm{Perm}(S)\) is a group homomorphism, then the rule
        <div class="math-display">
          \[g \cdot s := (\rho(g))(s)\]
        </div>
        defines an action of \(G\) on \(S\).
      </li>
    </ol>
  </section>

  <section class="callout proof" role="region">
    <h3>Proof of Lemma 2.1.3</h3>
    <p>
      (1) Assume we are given an action of \(G\) on \(S\). We first need to check that for all \(g\), \(\mu_g\) really is a permutation of \(S\).
      We will show this by proving that \(\mu_g\) has a two-sided inverse; in fact, that inverse is \(\mu_{g^{-1}}\).
    </p>
    <p>Indeed, we have</p>
    <div class="math-display">
      \[
      \begin{aligned}
      (\mu_g\circ\mu_{g^{-1}})(s) &=\mu_g(\mu_{g^{-1}}(s)) & \text{ by the definition of composition}\\
      &=g\cdot (g^{-1} \cdot s) & \text{ by the definition for } \mu_g \text{ and } \mu_{g^{-1}}\\
      &=(gg^{-1})\cdot s & \text{ by the definition of a group action}\\
      &=e_G\cdot s & \text{ by the definition of a group}\\
      &= s &\text{ by the definition of a group action}
      \end{aligned}
      \]
    </div>
    <p>
      thus \(\mu_g \circ \mu_{g^{-1}}=\mathrm{id}_S\), and a similar argument shows that \(\mu_{g^{-1}}\circ \mu_{g}=\mathrm{id}_S\) (exercise!).
      This shows that \(\mu_g\) has an inverse, and thus it is bijective; it must then be a permutation of \(S\).
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, we wish to show that \(\rho\) is a homomorphism of groups, so we need to check that \(\rho(gh)=\rho(g) \circ \rho(h)\).
      Equivalently, we need to prove that \(\mu_{gh}=\mu_g\circ\mu_{h}\).
      Now for all \(s\), we have
    </p>
    <div class="math-display">
      \[
      \begin{aligned}
      \mu_{gh}(s) & = (gh) \cdot s & \textrm{ by definition of $\mu$} \\
      & = g\cdot(h \cdot s) & \textrm{ by definition of a group action} \\
      & =\mu_g\left(\mu_{h}(s)\right) & \textrm{by definition of } \mu_g \textrm{ and } \mu_h \\
      & = (\mu_g \circ \mu_{h})(s).
      \end{aligned}
      \]
    </div>
    <p>This proves that \(\rho\) is a homomorphism.</p>
    <p>
      (2) On the other hand, given a homomorphism \(\rho\), the function
      <div class="math-display">
        \[
        (g,s) \mapsto g \cdot s = \rho(g)(s)
        \]

    </p>
    <div class="math-display">
      \[

      h \cdot (g \cdot s) & = \rho(h)(\rho(g)(s)) & \textrm{by definition of $\rho$}\\
      & = (\rho(h) \circ \rho(g))(s) \\

    <h3>Example 2.2.2</h3>
    <p>
      The group \(D_{n}\) acts on the vertices of \(P_n\), which we will label with \(V_1, \dots, V_{n}\) in a counterclockwise fashion, with \(V_1\) on the positive \(x\)-axis, as in Notation 1.3.11.
      Note that \(D_{n}\) acts on \(\{V_1, \dots, V_n \}\): for each \(g \in D_{n}\) and each integer \(1 \leqslant j \leqslant n\), we set

      Let \(\rho\!: D_{n} \to \mathrm{Perm}\!\left(\{V_1,\ldots,V_n\}\right)\cong S_n\) be the associated group homomorphism. Note that \(\rho\) is injective, because if an element  of \(D_{n}\) fixes all \(n\) vertices of a polygon, then it must be the identity map. More generally, if an isometry of \(\mathbb{R}^2\) fixes any three noncolinear points, then it is the identity. To see this, note that given three noncolinear points, every point in the plane is uniquely determined by its distance from these three points (exercise!).

    <p>
      The action of \(D_{n}\) on the \(n\) vertices of \(P_n\) is faithful; in fact, we saw before that each \(\sigma \in D_n\) is completely determined by what it does to any two adjacent vertices.

      The left regular action of \(G\) on itself is faithful, since if \(g \cdot x = x\) for all \(x\) (or even for just one \(x\)), then \(g = e\). It follows that the associated homomorphism is injective.

    <h3>Proof of Lemma 3.1.7</h3>
    <p>
      We prove the One-step test first.
      Assume \(H\) is nonempty and for all \(x,y \in H\) we have \(xy^{-1} \in H\).
      Since \(H\) is nonempty, there is some \(h \in H\), and hence \(e_G = hh^{-1} \in H\).
      Since \(e_Gx=x=xe_G\) for any \(x\in G\), and hence for any \(x \in H\),
      then \(e_G\) is an identity element for \(H\).
      For any \(h \in H\), we have that \(h^{-1} = eh^{-1} \in H\), and since in \(G\) we have
      \(h^{-1}h = e = hh^{-1} \in H\) and this calculation does not change when we restrict to \(H\),
      we can conclude that every element of \(H\) has an inverse inside \(H\).
      For every \(x,y \in H\) we must have \(y^{-1} \in H\) and thus
    </p>
    <div class="math-display">
      \[
      xy = x(y^{-1})^{-1} \in H

    <p>
      so \(H\) is closed under the multiplication operation.
      This means that the restriction of the group operation of \(G\) to \(H\) is a well-defined group operation.
      This operation is associative by the axioms for the group \(G\).
      The axioms of a group have now been established for \((H, \cdot)\).
    </p>

      Now we prove the Two-step test.
      Assume \(H\) is nonempty and closed under multiplication and taking inverses.
      Then for all \(x,y\in H\) we must have \(y^{-1}\in H\) and thus \(xy^{-1}\in H\).
      Since the hypothesis of the One-step test is satisfied, we conclude that \(H\) is a subgroup of \(G\).

    <h3>Proof of Lemma 3.1.8</h3>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>By definition, \(K\) is a group under the multiplication in \(H\), and the multiplication in \(H\) is the same as that in \(G\), so \(K\) is a subgroup of \(G\).</li>
      <li>
        First, note that \(H\) is nonempty since \(e_G \in H_\alpha\) for all \(\alpha\in J\).
        Moreover, given \(x,y\in H\), for each \(\alpha\) we have \(x,y \in H_\alpha\) and hence \(xy^{-1} \in H_\alpha\).
        It follows that \(xy^{-1} \in H\).
        By the Two-Step test, \(H\) is a subgroup of \(G\).
      </li>
      <li>
        Since \(G\) is nonempty, then \(\mathrm{im}(f)\) must also be nonemtpy; for example, it contains \(f(e_G) = e_H\).
        If \(x,y \in \mathrm{im}(f)\), then \(x = f(a)\) and \(y = f(b)\) for some \(a,b \in G\), and hence
        \[
        xy^{-1} =f(a)f(b)^{-1} = f(ab^{-1}) \in \mathrm{im}(f).
        \]
        By the Two-Step Test, \(\mathrm{im}(f)\) is a subgroup of \(H\).
      </li>
      <li>
        The restriction \(g\!: K \to H\) of \(f\) to \(K\) is still a group homomorphism, and thus \(f(K) = \mathrm{im}(g)\) is a subgroup of \(H\).
      </li>
      <li>
        Using the One-step test, note that if \(x, y \in \ker(f)\), meaning \(f(x)=f(y)=e_G\), then
        \[
        f(xy^{-1})=f(x)f(y)^{-1}=e_G.
        \]
        This shows that if \(x,y\in \ker(f)\) then \(xy^{-1}\in \ker(f)\), so \(\ker(f)\) is closed for taking inverses.
        By the Two-Step test, \(\ker(f)\) is a subgroup of \(G\).
      </li>
      <li>
        The center \(\mathrm{Z}(G)\) is the kernel of the permutation representation \(G\to \mathrm{Perm}(G)\) for the conjugation action, so \(\mathrm{Z}(G)\) is a subgroup of \(G\) since the kernel of a homomorphism is a subgroup.

      S= \left\{x_1^{j_1} \cdots x_m^{j_m} \mid m \geqslant 0, j_1, \dots, j_m \in \mathbb{Z} \text{ and }x_1, \dots, x_m \in X \right\}.
      \]
    </div>
     <p>
      Since \(\langle X \rangle\) is a subgroup that contains \(X\), it is closed under products and inverses, and thus must contain all elements of \(S\). Thus \(X \supseteq S\).
    </p>
    <p>
      To show \(X \subseteq S\), we will prove that the set \(S\) is a subgroup of \(G\) using the One-step test:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>\(S \neq \emptyset\) since we allow \(m = 0\) and
        declare the empty product to be \(e_G\).
      </li>
      <li>
        Let \(a\) and \(b\) be elements of \(S\), so that they can be written as
        \(a = x_1^{j_1} \cdots x_m^{j_m}\) and \(b= y_1^{i_1} \cdots y_n^{i_n}\). Then
        <div class="math-display">
          \[
          ab^{-1} = x_1^{j_1} \cdots x_m^{j_m}(y_1^{i_1} \cdots y_n^{i_m})^{-1}=
          x_1^{j_1} \cdots x_m^{j_m} y_n^{-i_n} \cdots y_1^{-i_1} \in S.
          \]
        </div>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Therefore, \(S\leq G\) and \(X\subseteq S\) (by taking \(m=1\) and \(j_1=1\)) and by the minimality of \(\langle X \rangle\) we conclude that \(\langle X \rangle\subseteq S\).

    <p>
      Suppose \(G\) is a finite group of order \(n\) and label the group elements of \(G\) from \(1\) to \(n\) in any way you like.
      The left regular action of \(G\) on itself determines a permutation representation \(\rho\!:G\to \mathrm{Perm}(G)\), which is injective.
      Note that since \(G\) has \(n\) elements, \(\mathrm{Perm}(G)\) is the group of permutations on \(n\) elements, and thus \(\mathrm{Perm}(G) \cong S_n\).
      By Lemma 3.1.8, \(\mathrm{im}(\rho)\) is a subgroup of \(S_n\).
      If we restrict \(\rho\) to its image, we get an isomorphism \(\rho\!: G \to \mathrm{im}(\rho)\).

    <h3>Proof</h3>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>
        <p>By the Lemma, we know \(G=\{x^i \mid i \in \mathbb{Z}\}\). Now we claim that the elements 
        $$e = x^0, x^1, \dots, x^{n-1}$$ 
        are all distinct. Indeed, if \(x^i=x^j\) for some \(0\leqslant i&lt;j&lt;n\), then \(x^{j-i}=e\) and \(1 \leqslant j-i&lt;n\), contradicting the minimality of the order \(n\) of \(x\). In particular, this shows that \(|G| \geqslant n\).</p>
        <p>Now take any \(m \in \mathbb{Z}\). By the Division Algorithm, we can write \(m = qn+r\) for some integers \(q, r\) with \(0 \le r &lt; n\). Then 
        $$x^m=x^{nq+r}=(x^n)^q x^r=x^r.$$
        This shows that every element in \(G\) can be written in the form \(x^r\) with \(0 \leqslant r &lt; n\), so
        $$G = \{x^0, x^1, \dots, x^{n-1}\} \qquad \textrm{and} \qquad |G| = n.$$
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>This is part of the Homework.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Consider any subgroup \(H\) of \(G\) with \(H \neq \{ e \}\), and set 
        $$k := \min \{i \in \mathbb{Z} \mid i&gt;0 \ \textrm{and}\ g^i\in H\}.$$ 
        On the one hand, \(H \supseteq \langle g^k \rangle\), since \(H \ni g^k\) and \(H\) is closed for products. Moreover, given any other positive integer \(i\), we can again write \(i = kq+r\) for some integers \(q, r\) with \(0 \leqslant r &lt; k\), and
        $$g^r = g^{i-kq} = g^i (g^{k})^{-q} \in H,$$
        so by minimality of \(k\) we conclude that \(r = 0\). Therefore, \(k \mid i\), and thus we conclude that
        $$H = \langle g^k \rangle.$$
        Now to show that \(\Psi\) is a bijection, we only need to prove that \(\Phi\) is a well-defined function and a two-sided inverse for \(\Psi\), and this we leave as an exercise. \( \)</p>

  <section class="callout proof" role="region">
    <h3>Proof</h3>
    <p>Recall that either \(G = \{e,x,x^2, \dots, x^{n-1}\}\) has exactly \(n\) elements if \(|x| = n\) or \(G = \{ x^i \mid i \in \mathbb{Z} \}\) with no repetitions if \(|x| = \infty\). </p>
    <p><u>Uniqueness:</u> We have already noted that any homomorphism is uniquely determined by the images of the generators of the domain in Remark 1.5.8, and that \(f\) must then be given by \(f(x^i) =f(x)^i = y^i\). </p>
    <p><u>Existence:</u> In either case, define \(f(x^i) = y^i\).  We must show this function is a well-defined group homomorphism.
    To see that \(f\) is well-defined, suppose \(x^i=x^j\) for some \(i,j\in \mathbb{Z}\). Then, since \(x^{i-j}=e_G\), using Lemma 3.3.5 we have
    $$\begin{cases}
    n\mid i-j & \text{ if } |x|=n\\[2pt]
    i-j=0 & \text{ if } |x|=\infty

    \begin{cases}

    Thus, if \(x^i=x^j\) then \(f(x^i)=y^i=y^j=f(x^j)\). In particular, if \(x^k = e\), then \(f(x^k) = e\), and \(f\) is well-defined.</p>
    <p>The fact that \(f\) is a homomorphism is immediate: 
    $$f(x^ix^j)=f(x^{i+j})=y^{i+j}=y^iy^j=f(x^i)f(x^j).  $$</p>

<h1 id="quotient groups section">4. Quotient groups</h1>

Recall from your undergraduate algebra course the construction for the integers modulo \(n\): one starts with an equivalence relation \(\sim\) on \(\mathbb{Z}\), considers the set \(\mathbb{Z}/n\) of all equivalence classes with respect to this equivalence relation, and verifies that the operations on \(\mathbb{Z}\) give rise to well defined binary operations on the set of equivalence classes. 

This idea still works if we replace \(\mathbb{Z}\) by an arbitrary group, but one has to be somewhat careful about what equivalence relation is used.

  <p>
    Let \(G\) be a group and consider an equivalence relation \(\sim\) on \(G\).
    Let \(G/\sim\) denote the set of equivalence classes for \(\sim\) and write
    \([g]\) for the equivalence class that the element \(g \in G\) belongs to, that is

    When does \(G/\sim\) acquire the structure of a group under the operation
  </p>
  <div class="math-display">\[[x] \cdot [y] := [xy] \ ?\]</div>
  <p>
    Right away, we should be worried about whether this operation is well-defined, meaning that it is independent of our choice of representatives for each class. That is, if \([x] = [x']\) and \([y] = [y']\) then must \([xy] = [x'y']\)? In other words, if \(x \sim x'\) and \(y \sim y'\), must \(xy \sim x'y'\)?
  </p>

  <section class="callout definition">
    <h3>Definition 4.1.1</h3>
    <p>
      We say an equivalence relation \(\sim\) on a group \(G\) is <strong>compatible with multiplication</strong> if \(x \sim y\) implies \(xz \sim yz\) and \(zx \sim zy\) for all \(x,y,z \in G\).
    </p>

  <section class="callout lemma">
    <h3>Lemma 4.1.2</h3>
    <p>
      For a group \(G\) and equivalence relation \(\sim\), the rule \([x] \cdot [y] = [xy]\) is well-defined and makes \(G/\sim\) into a group if and only if \(\sim\) is compatible with multiplication.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="callout proof">
    <h3>Proof of Lemma 4.1.2</h3>
    <p>
      To say that the rule \([x] \cdot [y] = [xy]\) is well-defined is to say that for all \(x, x', y, y' \in G\) we have
    </p>
    <div class="math-display">\[[x]=[x'] \textrm{ and } [y]=[y'] \implies [x][y]=[x'][y'].\]</div>
    <p>
      So \([xy]=[x'y']\) if and only if whenever \(x\sim x'\) and \(y\sim y'\), then \(xy\sim x'y'\).
    </p>
    <p>
      Assume \(\sim\) is compatible with multiplication. Then \(x\sim x'\) implies \(xy\sim x'y\) and \(y\sim y'\) implies \(x'y\sim x'y'\), hence by transitivity \(xy\sim x'y'\). Thus \([x] \cdot [y] = [xy]\) is well-defined.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conversely, assume the rule \([x] \cdot [y] = [xy]\) is well-defined, so that
    </p>
    <div class="math-display">\[[x]=[x'] \textrm{ and } [y]=[y'] \implies [x][y]=[x'][y'].\]</div>
    <p>
      Setting \(y=y'\) gives us
    </p>
    <div class="math-display">\[x\sim x' \implies xy\sim x'y.\]</div>
    <p>
      Setting \(x=x'\) gives us 
    </p>
    <div class="math-display">\[y\sim y' \implies xy\sim xy'.\]</div>
    <p>
      Hence \(\sim\) is compatible with multiplication.
    </p>
    <p>
      So now assume that the multiplication rule is well-defined, which we have now proved is equivalent to saying that \(\sim\) is compatible with the multiplication in \(G\). We need to prove that \(G/\sim\) really is a group. Indeed, since \(G\) itself is a group then given any \(x,y,z \in G\) we have 
    </p>
    <div class="math-display">\[[x] \cdot ([y] \cdot [z]) = [x] \cdot [yz] = [x(yz)] = [(xy)z] = [xy][z] = ([x][y])[z].\]</div>
    <p>
      Moreover, for all \(x \in G\) we have
    </p>
    <div class="math-display">\[[e_G] [x] = [e_G x] = [x] \qquad \textrm{and} \qquad  [x] [e_G] = [x e_G] = [x],\]</div>
    <p>
      so that \([e_G]\) is an identity for \(G/\sim\). Finally,
    </p>
    <div class="math-display">\[[x][x^{-1}] = [e_G] = e_{G/\sim},\]</div>
    <p>
      so that every element in \(G/\sim\) has an inverse; in fact, this shows that \([x]^{-1} = [x^{-1}]\).

      h\cdot g=hg \quad \textrm{for } h\in H, g\in G.
      \]
      The equivalence relation \(\sim_H\) on \(G\) induced by the left action of \(H\) is
      \[
      a \sim_H b \textrm{ if and only if } b = ha \text{ for some } h \in H.

      The equivalence class of \(g \in G\), also called the <strong>orbit</strong> of \(g\), and also called the <strong>right coset</strong> of \(H\) in \(G\) containing \(g\), is
      \[
      Hg := \{hg \mid h \in H\}.
      \]

That is, \( a \sim_H b\) if and only if \( Ha = Hb\).
      There is also a <strong>left coset</strong> of \(H\) in \(G\) containing \(g\), defined by

    <p>
      We will only prove the statements about left cosets, since the statements about right cosets are analogous.
    </p>
    <p>
      (1 ⇒ 2). Suppose that \(x\) and \(y\) belong to the same left coset \(gH\) of \(H\) in \(G\). Then \(x=ga\) and \(y=gb\) for some \(a,b \in H\), so  \(g=yb^{-1}\) and therefore \(x=yb^{-1}a=ya\) where \(h=b^{-1}a\in H\).
    </p>
    <p>
      (2 ⇔ 3). We have \(x=yh\) for some \(h \in H\) if and only if \(y = xh^{-1}\) and \(h^{-1} \in H\).
    </p>
    <p>
      (2 ⇔ 4). We have \(x=yh\) for some \(h \in H\) if and only if \(y^{-1} x=h\in H\).
    </p>
    <p>
      (4 ⇔ 5). Note that \(y^{-1} x\in H \Leftrightarrow (y^{-1} x)^{-1}\in H \iff x^{-1}y\in H\).
    </p>
    <p>
      (2 ⇒ 6). Suppose \(x = ya\) for some \(a \in H\). Then by (2 ⇒ 3) we also have \(y = xb\) for some \(b \in H\). Note that for all \(h \in H\), we also have \(ah \in H\) and \(bh \in H\). Then
    </p>
    <div class="math-display">\[

      yH= \{y h\mid h \in H\}=\{x(bh) \mid h \in H\} \subseteq xH.
    \]</div>
    <p>
      Therefore, \(xH=yH\).
    </p>
    <p>
      (6 ⇒ 1). Since \(e_G=e_H\in H\), we have \(x=xe_G\in xH\) and \(y=ye_G\in yH\). If \(xH=yH\) then,  \(x\) and \(y\) belong to the same left coset.

    <h3>Lemma 4.1.9</h3>
    <p>
      For \(H \leq G\), the collection of left cosets of \(H\) in \(G\) form a partition of \(G\), and similarly for the collection of right cosets: 
    </p>
    <div class="math-display">\[
      \bigcup_{x\in G} xH=G
    \]</div>
    <p>
      and for all \(x,y \in G\), either \(xH = yH\) or \(xH \cap yH = \emptyset\).
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, all left and right cosets have the same cardinality: for any \(x\in G\),
    </p>
    <div class="math-display">\[|xH| = |Hx|=|H|.\]</div>
  </section>

  <section class="callout proof">
    <h3>Proof of Lemma 4.1.9</h3>
    <p>
      Since the left (respectively, right) cosets are the equivalence classes for an equivalence relation, the first part of the statement is just a special case of a general fact about equivalence relation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us nevertheless write a proof for the assertions for right cosets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every element \(g \in G\) belongs to at least one right coset, since \(e \in H\) gives us \(g \in Hg\). Thus
    </p>
    <div class="math-display">\[\bigcup_{x\in G} xH=G.\]</div>
    <p>
      Now we need to show any two cosets are either identical or disjoint: if \(Hx\) and \(Hy\) share an element, then it follows from (1 ⇒ 6) of Lemma 4.1.7 that \(Hx=Hy\). This proves that the right cosets partition \(G\).
    </p>
    <p>
      To see that all right cosets have the same cardinality as \(H\), consider the function
    </p>
    <div class="math-display">\[\rho: H \to Hg \quad \textrm{defined by} \quad \rho(h) = hg.\]</div>
    <p>
      This function \(\rho\) is surjective by construction. Moreover, if \(\rho(h) = \rho(h')\) then \(hg = h'g\) and thus \(h = h'\). Thus \(\rho\) is also injective, and therefore a bijection, so \(|Hg| = |H|\).

    <p>Moreover, \(\im(f) = \im(\overline{f})\). In particular, if \(f\) is surjective, then \(\overline{f}\) is also surjective. Finally,

      \ker(\overline{f}) = \ker(f)/N := \{ g N \mid f(g) = e_H\}.

  </section>

  <section class="callout proof" role="region" aria-labelledby="prf-4-4-1">
    <h3 id="prf-4-4-1">Proof (of Theorem 4.4.1)</h3>
    <p>Suppose that such a homomorphism \(\overline{f}\) exists. 
    Since \(f=\pi\circ \overline f\), then \(\overline{f}\) has to be given by 
    \[
      \overline{f}(gN) = \overline{f}(\pi(g)) = f(g).
    \]
    In particular, \(\overline f\) is necessarily unique. To show existence, we just need to show that this formula determines a well-defined homomorphism. Given \(xN = yN\), we have
    \[
      y^{-1}x \in N \subseteq \ker(f)
    \] 
    and so 
    \[
      f(y)^{-1} f(x) = f(y^{-1}x) = e \implies f(y) = f(x).
    \] 
    This shows that \(\overline{f}\) is well-defined. Moreover, for any \(x,y \in G\), we have
    \[
      \overline{f}((xN)(yN)) = \overline{f}((xy)N) = f(xy) = f(x)f(y) =\overline{f}(xN) \overline{f}(yN).
    \]
    Thus \(\overline{f}\) is a group homomorphism.</p>

    <p>The fact that \(\im f=\im \overline f\) is immediate from the formula for \(\overline f\) given above, and hence \(f\) is surjective if and only if \(\overline f\) is surjective.</p>

    <p>Finally, we have 
    \[
      xN \in \ker (\overline{f}) \iff \overline{f}(xN) = e_H \iff f(x) = e_H \iff x \in \ker(f).
    \] 

    Therefore, if \(xN \in \ker (\overline{f})\) then \(xN \in  \ker(f)/N\).
    On the other hand, if \(xN \in \ker(f)/N\) for some \(x \in G\), then \(xN = yN\) for some \(y \in \ker(f)\) and hence \(x = yz\) for some \(z \in N\). Since \(N \subseteq \ker(f)\), then \(x, y \in \ker(f)\), and thus we conclude that \(x = yz \in \ker(f)\).</p>

  <p>In short, the UMP of quotient groups says that to give a homomorphism from a quotient \(G/N\) is the same as to give a homomorphism from \(G\) with kernel containing \(N\).</p>

    Let us first restrict the target of \(f\) to \(\im(f)\), so that we can assume without loss of generality that \(f\) is surjective.
    By \Cref{UMP quotient group}, there exists a (unique) homomorphism \(\overline{f}\) such that \(\overline{f} \circ \pi = f\), where \(\pi\!: G \to G/\ker(f)\) is the canonical projection. Moreover, the kernel \(\ker(f)/\ker(f)\) of \(\overline{f}\) consists of just one element, the coset \(\ker(f)\) of the identity, and so \(\overline{f}\) it injective. Moreover, \Cref{UMP quotient group} also says that the image of \(\overline{f}\) equals the image of \(f\). We conclude that \(\overline{f}\) is an isomorphism.</p>

    We claim that \(H = \SL_n(F)\), the square matrices with determinant \(1\), is a normal subgroup of \(G = \GL_n(F)\). Indeed, given \(A \in \GL_n(F)\) and \(B \in \SL_n(F)\), then
    \[
      \det(ABA^{-1}) = \det(A) \underset{1}{\underbrace{\det(B)}} \det(A)^{-1} = \det(A) \det(A)^{-1} = 1,

    so \(ABA^{-1} \in H\). 
    The map

    <p>Recall that \((\{\pm 1\}, \cdot)\) is a group with \(\cdot\) the usual multiplication. Define \(f\!: D_{n} \longrightarrow \{\pm 1\}\) by

  <p>Before we prove what is known as the Third Isomorphism Theorem, we need to get a better understanding of the subgroups of a quotient group. That is the content of what is known as the Lattice Isomorphism Theorem, sometimes (rarely?) called the Fourth Isomorphism Theorem.</p>

  <section class="callout theorem" role="region" aria-labelledby="thm-4-4-14">
    <h3 id="thm-4-4-14">Theorem 4.4.14 (The Lattice Isomorhism Theorem)</h3>
    <p>Let \(G\) be a group and \(N\) a normal subgroup of \(G\), and let \(\pi\!: G \twoheadrightarrow G/N\) be the quotient map. There is an order-preserving bijection of posets (a lattice isomorphism)
    \[
      \xymatrix@R=1mm@C=15mm{
      \{\text{subgroups of $G$ that contain $N$}\} \ar@<0.5ex>[r]^-{\Psi} & \ar@<0.5ex>[l]^-{\Phi} \{\text{subgroups of $G/N$}\} \\

      <li>Subgroups correspond to subgroups:

  <section class="callout proof" role="region" aria-labelledby="prf-4-4-14">
    <h3 id="prf-4-4-14">Proof (of Theorem 4.4.14)</h3>
    <p>We showed in \Cref{lemma quotient map} that the quotient map \(\pi\!:G\to G/N\) is a surjective group homomorphism. It will be useful to rewrite the maps in the statement of the theorem in terms of \(\pi\).
    Notice that \(\Psi(H)=H/N=\{hN \mid h\in H\}=\pi(H)\).
    Note that \(\Psi\) does indeed land in the correct codomain, since by \Cref{subgroups examples} images of subgroups through group homomorphisms are subgroups, and thus \(\pi(H)\leq G/N\) for each \(H \leq G\). Thus \(\Psi\) is well-defined.
    We claim \(\Phi\) also lands in the correct codomain. Indeed, by \Cref{preimage is a subgroup} preimages of subgroups through group homomorphisms are subgroups, and thus in particular for each \(A \leq G\) we have \(\pi^{-1}(A)\leq G\). Moreover, for any \(A \leq G\) we have
    \(\{e_GN\} \subseteq A\), hence 
    \[
      N = \ker(\pi) = \pi^{-1}(\{e_GN\}) \subseteq \pi^{-1}(A) = \Phi(A).
    \]
    Thus \(\Psi\) is well-defined.</p>

    <p>To show that \(\Psi\) is bijective, we will show that \(\Phi\) and \(\Psi\) are mutual inverses. First, note that since \(\pi\) is surjective, then \(\pi(\pi^{-1}(A))=A\) for all subgroups \(A\) of \(G/N\), and thus
    \[
      (\Psi\circ\Phi)(A)=\pi(\pi^{-1}(A))=A.
    \]
    Moreover, 
    \[
    \begin{aligned}
        x\in \pi^{-1}(H/N) &\iff \pi(x)\in H/N \\
        & \iff xN=hN & \text{ for some } h\in H \\
        & \iff x\in hN & \text{ for some } h\in H \\
        & \iff x\in H & \text{since } N\subseteq H.
    \end{aligned}
    \]
    Thus
    \[
      (\Phi\circ\Psi)(H)=\pi^{-1}(\pi(H))=\pi^{-1}(H/N)=H.
    \]
    Thus, \(\Psi\) and \(\Phi\) are well-defined and inverse to each other. Since \(\pi\) and \(\pi^{-1}\) both preserve containments, each of \(\Psi\), \(\Psi^{-1}\) preserves containments as well.</p>

    <p>Again by \Cref{subgroups examples} and \Cref{preimage is a subgroup}, images and preimages of subgroups by group homomorphisms are subgroups, which proves (1). Moreover, if \(N \leq H \leq G\) and \(H \trianglelefteq G\), then \(ghg^{-1} \in H\) for all \(g \in G\) and all \(h \in G\), and thus
    \[
      (gN)(hN)(gN)^{-1}= (ghg^{-1})N \in H/N.
    \]
    Therefore, if \(N \leq H \trianglelefteq G\), then \(H/N \trianglelefteq G/N\). Finally, by \Cref{preimage of normal subgroup is normal}, the preimage of a normal subgroup is normal. We have now shown (2).</p>

    <p>We leave (3) as an exercise, and (4) is a consequence of the more general fact that lattice isomorphisms preserve suprema and infima.</p>

    <p>The kernel of the canonical map \(\pi: G \twoheadrightarrow G/N\) contains \(M\), and so by \Cref{UMP quotient group} we get an induced homomorphism
