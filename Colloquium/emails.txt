Title: The implicitization problem and Rees rings

Abstract: A classical problem in elimination theory is called the implicitization
problem. This problem consists of determining the equations of a variety
that is given parametrically and has been extensively studied by applied
mathematicians in geometric modeling and computer aided design. In this
talk we will talk about the role Rees rings play in the implicitization
problem. We will also explain how knowing the types of singularities of
a variety can inform the search for its implicit equations.

Title:  Polynomial interpolation and beyond

Abstract: Polynomial interpolation is an important subject in many areas of mathematics, from approximating functions in analysis and curve fitting in statistics to Hilbert functions in commutative algebra.  The simplest case is the problem solved by Lagrangian interpolation, which discusses when a single variable polynomial can have prescribed values at fixed points.  Moving on, when the polynomials have several variables, the interpolation problem becomes much more challenging and depends heavily on the position of the points.  For instance, if 3 points are collinear, then if we know the values of a linear polynomial at two of the points then we also know it at the third.

After introducing several basic interpolation problems, we will turn to studying the following problem.  Given a collection of $n$ points in the plane, what is the most interesting codimension 1 property that those points can satisfy?  For example, it is one condition on the coordinates of 3 points for them to lie on a line.  We will phrase this problem in terms of the computation of effective divisors on the Hilbert scheme of points in the plane, and see how a natural generalization of the polynomial interpolation problem provides the answer.

Subject: Fall 2023 Colloquium Series
To: Faculty Listserv <math-faculty@lists.nebraska.edu>




Dear colleagues,

I’m writing to encourage you to invite colloquium speakers for the 2023–2024 academic year. We will continue to have colloquia on Fridays from 4:00–4:50, with refreshments at 3:30. If possible, we would like to have a colloquium nearly every week. Outside visitors, as well as local speakers from our department or other departments at UNL are encouraged. In particular, feel free to invite yourself!

You can find open dates here, and general information about the colloquium, including the list of upcoming talks, scheduling information, and expectations for colloquia on the usual colloquium website:

https://math.unl.edu/colloquia

Should you have a visitor or be thinking of a visitor who would give a good colloquium, please write to me with 
their name,
date requested, and
affiliation
and I will add them to the schedule.

When you consider inviting someone as a possible colloquium speaker, please consider whether that person is likely to give a good talk to a general mathematical audience. It is not good when a speaker gives a specialized seminar that only a very few in the colloquium audience can follow. Here are some guidelines that speakers should follow (you should let the speakers you host know these):
Colloquia are to be 50 minutes long.
The audience for a colloquium expects a lecture geared to non-specialists. Give motivation for the work to be discussed and target the lecture for a very general mathematical audience—a first or second year graduate student should understand most of the talk. It is usually a good idea to remind the audience of definitions.
Speakers are advised to consult with UNL's Friendly Advice for Colloquium Speakers. Speakers might also wish to consult John McCarthy's excellent article, "How to give a good colloquium''.
With best wishes for the end of the summer and the new school year,
-Jack
